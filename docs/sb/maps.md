# Squad Busters Maps

The soft launch is releasing 4 different worlds, and each of them has 3 different maps.

On top of those, the Green World maps have variants to allow for more complex mechanics. Examples of these are carrots for Mavis and tool spawns for Bea and Tank. This means that in total, there are 15 main maps to play in.

- Tools: either hives for Bea or tanks for Tank

### Kinds of terrain

- Water or mountains: terrain that can't be reached

- Grass: smooth terrain

- Low Grass: behaves the same as normal grass, but is used to label the main paths of the map, usually to guide players towards chests

- Tall Grass: a kind of grass that slows you down and can hide rewards

- Sand: a kind of terrain that slows you down

- Carrots: can be looted by Mavis or some spells

- Permanent Bridge: behaves like normal grass

- Spikes: periodically pop out and can damage players
