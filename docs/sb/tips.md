# Tips

## Beginner

### Keep the Chest Queue Going

You can get a free chest every 3 hours, but that process stops once you have 3 chests in the queue. Try to play regularly to keep the countdown active.

It's important to also know that if you fill the queue, your ongoing timer will be removed. So for example, if you are going to get another chest in 10 minutes but you buy 3 chests, that timer will be reset to 3 hours.

### Buying Chests

Spending gold to buy 3 chests will be the main way to speed up your progression. Before you buy them, check if:

- You have a win streak active
- The current timer is about to give you a free chest

### Book Achievements

Always collect all your Book Achievement rewards, you can't keep progressing until you do.

### Fusions Are Stronger!

Troop Fusions have around 3x HP and 2x Damage. You can find more about Fusion stats [here](/sb/troops_fusion_multipliers).

### Chest Keys

Defeating other squads and some boss monsters will give you chest keys. These keys allow you to open your next chest for free. Remember to collect that key, or you won't get a free chest!

### Shining Grass

Tall grass can hide some small rewards that can be very relevant to kick off your progression. You can find them by stepping over tall grass that has a golden shine. 

### Boost Boots

Boots can make you move and attack faster. Brief taps can give you small boosts that allow you to save some for later. Don't be afraid to spend this boost, as it recharges automatically after some time.

### Blue Boxes

In some game modes it can be harder to find Boost Boots. Blue Boxes are a reliable source to get them, but you'll have to open them before other players do.

### Aim Your Spells

Drag your spell icon to choose where to drop it. This is very important to place cannons and drop bombs on top of your enemies.

## Intermediate

### Deselect Your Spells

If you are aiming to throw a spell but you want to cancel, you can simply drag away from your throw range. You'll see that the aim aid disappears, and then it's safe to let go.

### Training Mode

On the Squad tab, after selecting a troop, you can enter the training mode, where you can peacefully practice and test troop mechanics.

### Troop Collection Balance

For your squad collection, drop chances from chests take into account how many you already have. So for example, if you have a Super Goblin and your other troops are behind, you are unlikely to get more goblins.

This is great to evolve new troops, but it can slow down the progression of your most abundant troops. Due to this, buying your favourite troop will most likely not be significant in the long term; instead, focus on increasing your total amount of troops.

### Explosive Harvester

Greg and Mavis are the traditional way of looting trees and carrots, but you can also use bombs! Aim for several trees and carrots if you can.

### Enemy Indicators

Close-by squads and busted squads are indicated in the border of your screen. You can pay attention if you want to stay away before it's too late.

### Fusion Indicators

When squads are big, it can be a bit challenging to distinguish fusions from normal troops.

## Advanced

### Party Up!

Playing with friends can be advantageous. You won't be able to earn trophies in Party, but you can earn other rewards and grow your Top 5 Streak.

### Chest Before Key

If you bust a squad and have a chest nearby, opening the chest first will save you some gold. You can then pick the key and use it for what would have been a more expensive chest.

### Streak Optimisation

Top 5 Streaks are key to get big chests, so understanding them will allow you to progress efficiently. Learn all about them [here](/sb/chest_sizes.html#should-you-pay-to-keep-your-streak).

## Modifier Specific

### Dopplegangers

Troops that trigger abilities on spawn are very powerful here. Try to switch between them so that your whole squad is converted.

For example, getting another Goblin will give you a few coins, but converting your whole squad into Goblins will be much better!

Some troops that are interesting for their spawn ability:

- Goblin: gives coins
- Chicken: gives boost boots
- Nita: spawns bears that stay even if Nita is switched

### Double Trouble

When you get troops in pairs, the progression is:

1. 2 Normal troops
2. 1 Normal and 1 Fusion troop
3. 2 Fusion troops

Notice that your squad size doesn't change; it's always 2 for each of the 3 stages.
